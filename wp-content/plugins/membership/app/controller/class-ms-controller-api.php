/**
 * Exposes the public API.
 *
 * The simplest way to use the API is via an WordPress action `ms_init` that
 * runs some code as soon as the API becomes available:
 *
 *     // Run some code as early as possible.
 *     add_action( 'ms_init', 'my_api_hook' );
 *     function my_api_hook( $api ) {
 *         $memberships = $api->list_memberships();
 *     }
 *
 * **Recommended implementation structure**
 *
 *     class My_Membership2_Implementation {
 *         protected $api = null;
 *
 *         // Function is always executed. Will create 1 Implementation object.
 *         static public function setup() {
 *             static $Inst = null;
 *             if ( null === $Inst ) {
 *                 $Inst = new My_Membership2_Implementation();
 *             }
 *         }
 *
 *         // Function set up the api hook.
 *         private function __construct() {
 *             add_action( 'ms_init', array( $this, 'init' ) );
 *         }
 *
 *         // Function is only run when Membership2 is present + active.
 *         public function init( $api ) {
 *             $this->api = $api;
 *             // The main init code should come here now!
 *         }
 *
 *         // Add other event handlers and helper functions.
 *         // You can use $this->api in other functions to access the API object.
 *     }
 *     My_Membership2_Implementation::setup();
 *
 * ----------------
 *
 * We also add the WordPress filter `ms_active` to check if the plugin is
 * enabled and loaded. As long as this filter returns `false` the API cannot
 * be used:
 *
 *     // Check if the API object is available.
 *     if ( apply_filters( 'ms_active', false ) ) { ... }
 *
 * To directly access the API object use the property `MS_Plugin::$api`.
 * Note: Before `ms_active` is called `MS_Plugin::$api` will return false.
 * This should only be used in rare cases when you know that the API is
 * available; it's better to use the action `ms_init` for API access.
 *
 *     // Same as above.
 *     if ( MS_Plugin::$api ) { ... }

	 *
	 * 1. Copy the folder "/app/gateway/manual" to the "wp-contents/plugins"
	 *    folder, and name it "membership-mygateway"
	 *
	 * 2. Rename all files inside the "membership-mygateway" and replace the
	 *    term "manual" with "mygateway"
	 *
	 * 3. Edit all files, rename the class names inside the files to
	 *    "_Mygateway" (replacing "_Manual")
	 *
	 * 4. In class MS_Gateway_Mygateway make following changes:
	 *   - Set the value of const ID to "mygateway"
	 *
	 *   - Change the assigned name in function "after_load"
	 *
	 *   - Add a plugin header to the file, e.g.
	 *     /*
	 *      * Plugin name: Membership 2 Mygateway
	 *      * /
	 *
	 *   - Add the following line to the bottom of the file:
